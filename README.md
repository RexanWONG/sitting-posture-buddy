# Sitting Posture Buddy

## ðŸ‘‹ Hey!
Welcome to SittingPostureBuddy.  This section will guide you through the basics of getting started and give some background on how this app was built.  Estimated read time is ~5 mins.

## Using the app
Here's a working demo of the app.  A couple of tips to help you get started so the app will produce the best sitting posture detection results : 

- 1. Get something like a tripod to hold your iPhone vertically.
- 2. Position your iphone ~1 meter away from where you're sitting.  The camera should capture the entire side view of your body.
- 3. Try experimenting by switching your sitting posture from an upright posture to a bad posture.  When your sitting posture becomes bad, you will hear an alert sound.  The app makes a judgement of your sitting posture every 2 seconds, and displays it on the screen. : either a bad posture or a good posture, with the confidence level of its judgement

## Why Build?
In this day and age, we spend a lot of time sitting in front of computers.  While we are focused and in our zone, we tend to forgot about our sitting posture and end up sitting like a cooked spaghetti noodle.  \n\nHaving a bad sitting posture can lead to back pain.  Personally, I spend a lot of time coding in front of my computer, and often I end up with a bad posture and nothing to remind me to sit back straight since my eyes were glued to the screen.  \n\nOne day, I was browsing through the CreateML docs on the Apple website, and my back started to hurt.  \n\nThat's when I got the idea : I'll build an app that tracks my sitting posture in real time and alerts me briefly when it detects that my sitting posture is bad.
